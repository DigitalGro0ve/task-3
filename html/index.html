    <p>
      League of Legends is a multiplayer online battle arena, also known as a
      MOBA. It’s been one of the most popular games of all time and currently
      one of the biggest esports. In a standard game of League, ten players are
      split into two teams of five and battle it out on a map called Summoner’s
      Rift. Each of these players controls a single character, known as a
      champion.

    <h2 id="2">What is champion?</h2>
    <p>
      All ten players in a League of Legends match controls a single champion.
      There are currently over 140 champions with new ones being continuously
      added over time. Every champion has special abilities and powers with
      unique playstyles. Before a game begins at champ select, each team takes
      turns selecting champions. There’s a lot of strategies involved as you
      work with your team to create teams with champions that work well together
      (more on this later). Every game you play can be vastly different since
      every champion has their own feel and gameplan.

    <h2 id="3">How do you win?</h2>
    <p>
      The ultimate goal of LoL is to destroy the other team’s base, but it’s not
      easy. Your enemies will do everything they can to kill you and destroy
      your base. Each base has a series of turrets and waves of minions that
      constantly spawn. If you started a game and tried to run straight to the
      enemy base, you’d certainly die, not just because the enemy team would be
      trying to stop you at all costs, but also because you may be too weak and
      die. League is sort of like a role-playing game (RPG) that takes place in
      a very short amount of time. You begin at level 1 and gradually get
      stronger throughout the game by gaining experience and earning gold to buy
      items. The two teams continually grow in power and collide. Eventually,
      one team is able to get the upper hand and make a final push for a
      victory.
